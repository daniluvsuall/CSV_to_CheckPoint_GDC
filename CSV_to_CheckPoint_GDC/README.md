I am not a developer!

This is my (probably very poor) attempt at pulling a CSV, tidying it up and creating suitable JSON format
that a Check Point management server will accept for a GDC (Generic Data Center) type object will accept.

This was born from me wanting to import a list of DNS over HTTPS servers as an object, for filtering.

Using a different CSV may break this.
